# Conner Caprio Web App

To be hosted at: [Conner Caprio Web App](https://connercaprio.azurewebsites.net/)

This is a small web app to accomplish 3 main goals
- Showcase technical knowledge of .NET 6 and React
- Cement Existing Knowledge and increase knowledge base
- Have a personal site for my friends and I to use

## Showcase technical knowledge of .NET 6 and React

This site proves to current and possible new employers that I possess the technical knowledge to build a web application using the latest and most popular tools and frameworks

## Cement Existing Knowledge and increase knowledge base

My professional experience with .NET has been using the older (but still supported) .NET Framework and a .NET 6 project. Both of which I was not a part of when starting the project at
 the very beginning. Because of this people can fall into the trap of just adding on more code and following the precedents already set by the previous developers. By making this project
 from scratch I can confirm my knowledge and learn how to build enterprise apps from the inception phase.

## Have a personal site for my friends and I to use
A side aspect of this project is to track wines that my friends and I have tried. Trying new varietals and logging them can be a fun activity that doesn't feel repetitive
